## Process

### Frame

    Frame the problem
    Understand exactly what you are trying to solve

### Hypothesize

    Try to come up with an idea for what might happen if you do a certain thing.
    If you want something to work in a specific way, come up with an idea how you may
    address that problem. Personally when it comes to geometry nodes, you are limited by 
    what you do not know when it comes to each individual node. The more you work with the nodes
    the better you may have a n idea of how you may address that problem

### Test

    Test it, and do the thing. And if that works, great. If not
    see it from a learn perspective.
